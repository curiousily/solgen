Simple template generator for problems at http://uva.onlinejudge.org/

Instructions for installation:

1. Install ruby (this code is developed with version 1.9.1 but probably will be compatible with 1.8.7 and >1.9.1)
2. Install git (more info at http://git-scm.com/)
3. Do a clone: 
	git clone git@github.com:venelin/solgen.git
4. Edit solutions-dir in solgen/config/conf.yaml
5. sudo chmod +x solgen.rb

Create template:

1. ./solgen.rb Problem-Number Problem-Name
	(If you don't format properly your arguments the behaviour of Solgen is unpredictable)
2. Solve that problem and have fun :)

Run tests:

1. Fill the expected.txt in your project with data that you expect your solution to generate
2. Fill the out.txt in your project with data generated from your solution
3. ./solgen.rb t Problem-Number Problem-Name
4. Enjoy the results and have fun :)
